# 🎮 Stick Stretch Game

This project is a fun and challenging **Stick Stretch Game** where players must stretch a stick to reach platforms without falling off. The game tests your sense of timing and distance as you help the character move across floating platforms by accurately stretching a stick bridge!

## 📋 Overview

Players stretch a stick by holding down the mouse and then release it to drop the stick across to the next platform.
